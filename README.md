Some basic rules:

- NO pushing to master branch.
- Create branches of your own name to work with. Push to this branch and then create a Pull Request.
- Pull requests will be resolved by Anubhav, Mahesh.
- If you have made any mistake, DON'T PANIC. This is Git. Nothing is lost. Ask someone to help you recover it.
